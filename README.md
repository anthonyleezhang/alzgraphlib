Tools and utility functions for R

This is an in-progress library for descriptive data analysis in R, using primarily data.table and ggplot2. It's in-progress and semi-actively updated, so there's little documentation and syntax/functionality may change dramatically with little notice. You can reach me at anthonyz@stanford.edu with any questions/comments/suggestions.
